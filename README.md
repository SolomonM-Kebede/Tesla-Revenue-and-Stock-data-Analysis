# Tesla-Revenue-and-Stock-data-Analysis
This project includes scraping of Tesla's SEC fillings with BeautifulSoup4 to get the Revenue data from 2010 to 2025. Tesla's stock data also fetched from yahoo using yfinances Ticker. There are uncleaned as well as cleaned version of CSV files for Tesla quarterly revenue. Moreover, there is also the compiled annual revenue report. 
# Packages 
For Scraping Beautiful Soup 4 have been used with re to search and  match different format and units in the Filling. Pandas,Plotly, Matplotlib and Numpy are also Libraries used in the process. 

# How to run
Since there is no direct support of Pyplot visulaization in GitHub for Jupyter notebook , I made the same interactive graph using Power BI and uploaded it above. Moreover, if you are insterested to try Streamlit, 
here is the link for interactive UI and beautiful Data Visualization : https://teslarevenueandstock.streamlit.app/
Requirement: Use two csv files above tesla_revenue.csv and tesla_stock.csv in this repo and upload it in the upload_box respectively. Then everything works like a magic. :)
or 
open Power BI Tesla_revenue_visual.pbix file to see using power BI.
You can also Copy and paste the code , run it on your IDE and don't forget to use your email adress, if you want to try to scrap Tesla's page using my code. If anyone want to use any of the uploaded csv files for further analysis , feel free to use it and I would be happy if you let me know via zesolomenki@gmail.com.
